### Figures
**/figures/metrics**   
For each dataset, the following figures are available:  
* original-network-metrics  
   Plot showing the network measures for each original graph in the dataset    
* original-<metric name>-density  
   Plots of the density distribution of node metrics for each original graphs in a dataset  
* original-degree-dist
   Plots of the degree distribution for each of the original graphs in a dataset  
**/figures/node-centrality**
For each dataset, the following figure is available:
* <dataset name>-centrality-similarity
   Plots of how similar the 5 nodes with the highest or lowest degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality values for the time-averaged graphs are to the top or bottom 5 nodes from the original graphs

**/figures/null-models**
For each dataset, the following figures are available:
* me_ta-to-orig
   Comparison of network metric values for each time-averaged graph to a null model based on the original graphs
* all_ta_me
   Comparison of the network metric values for each time-averaged graph to null models based on the time-averaged graphs

**/figures/pca**
For each dataset, the following figure is available:
* pca-biplot
   PCA based on the network metric values for the time-averaged graphs with the original graphs (blue squares) plotted on
