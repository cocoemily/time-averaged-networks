This (pp. 79-80) ñaccords well with the historical evidence of the Periplus: if it was written in the mid 1st century AD, as is generally accepted, the pottery should pre-date this, as by the time Diodorus Island had become unsafe and the harbour moved to the island of Dese.î"

The burials found are associated with these occupational remains. On a first glance her argumentation is entirely convincing, as the quern fragment need not belong to the same period as the pottery. Due to the lack of datable material, it is difficult to date more closely the Roman activity on the spur. The lamp fragment and the red-slipped sherds imply that the area was inhabited some time during the 4th century and later."

The range of Black Rim Ware, particularly the variants of C 10 and L 14, are consistent with a date range in the first half of the 2nd century. This assemblage is outstanding both for the large quantity of a thin-walled ware not closely paralleled outside Carthage and for the number of coarse ware lids, also in a form which is exceptionally rare outside this context. It is possible that these unusual vessels represent evidence of pottery manufacture close to the harbourside (above, p. 9).

The well came into use again in the Augustan period, following building activities in the immediate area which also included partly filling the well. At one point it was sealed with two limestone blocks, which, if we were to follow Mackensen, took place in the period AD 550-650. Of interest is a small group of fragments (including some complete vessels) of mid-first century AD date, perhaps including the third quarter, that are early variants of ARSW and of presumed local manufacture (with reference to Fulford 1984).

I have treated these contexts as one group or one operation, though such is not specifically indicated in the publication. The fill is interpreted as an operation to level the ïheight differenceÍ between a walking level outside the precinct wall and the top of the temple platform. The construction fill of the atrium (F770) sealed the levelling fill proper, which itself rested upon floor F779. The datable material from the fill should provide a chronological indication about the construction of the southern portico of the atrium. So it seems as if this levelling fill and the construction fill of the atrium (or at least its southern portico), the latter superimposed upon the former, are stratigraphically and chronologically linked: pottery from the fill may provide a terminus post quem for the construction (level) of the atrium. I cannot make out whether the four pottery contexts from this fill were chronologically separated or separable, or the fill is seen as one unit; see above however. Yet, a considerable quantity of the pottery was Early Roman/Roman, and not much of Late Roman date."

I assume that the robbing took place first, then followed by construction activities. Included are, as above, earlier fragments yet pottery datable to the first phase of the Church seem absent (possibly except no. 72). This, however, need not be surprising, as it is the floor of which it is mentioned that it is associated with the construction of the floor; whether or not B1151 and B1159 are also is not mentioned. Basically, these two contexts are similar to B1143 and B1158, except for the presence of some Byzantine fragments. The early cooking ware fragments ïseem to be associated with the chronological horizon of the ESAÍ. This refers to an ESA fragment attributed to Form 28, which is not catalogued/illustrated."

Those pottery pieces in the group which can be dated at the narrowest (specifically, ESA nos. 78-79), pin-point this event at not earlier than the Augustan period'. This in fact concerns a sondage in the eastern portico of the atrium of the NWC. The suggested terminus post quem also depends on the Form-identification of no. 78, either Form 8 (50-1 BC, though the author indicates a date in the third quarter of the first century BC) or Form 29 (30 BC-AD 25). I have tentatively attributed it to the latter."

Perhaps there is a link with the layer with ïtraces of burningÍ? This is not likely, as F1157 may be intermediate? The author uses the two ESA fragments as the main dating criteria, and dates the context to the second half of the second century BC. Specifically mentioned is a carinated casserole, usually attributed to the Roman period (a parallel from Tel Anafa is dated to the late first century BC and the early first century AD): This seems to be in favour of a local Hellenistic origin of this form of cooking vessel.Í"

As a result, younger finds may have become mixed up with older finds, although natural factors (e.g. bioturbation) are also considered. One coin was found, a Domitianic As. Both the glass and the oil lamps are not considered in establishing the date of the 'fill'. Of primary use are the ESA finds, and the absence of ESA Form 56 is used to argue for a date around the mid-second century AD, certainly not later. P. 280: ""Der Fundkomplex 98/3ist somit nach Ausweis der hier besprochenen Funde in einen Zeitraum von wenigen Jahrzehnten um die Mitte des zweiten nachchristlichen Jahrhunderts zu datieren. Das fehlen von Metallfunde und der ser fragmentarischer Zustand des Glases legen eine Interpretation des Fundkomplex als Abfallschicht nahe.""

Its exact nature is also not clarified here, for whether it can be associated with the house's first construction phase (as Context 180 was) remains a question for now. Concerning the catalogue, Reynolds draws attention to the fact that the two pieces found in Context 152 (which overlay 180) are in fact not typical for their suggested prototypes in the Conspectus. It seems as if Reynolds is confused about the dates, since he proposed a Tiberian date for fig. 3.3, yet a mid-first century AD date for fig. 3.5 but in the latter entry he writes ñThis piece may be of similar, late, date to Fig. 3.3î.

Slane (1991, in Gnomon, pp. 150-4) suggests that, since the numismatic and lamp evidence cannot supply sound dating evidence for the tablewares, several vessels are dated too early. Parallels do not exist in the first-century BC repertoire, and those cited are Augustan or later."
1969,PERGA88-Zisterne 3 FÙllung 2,-50,-1,Quadrant I 17.,not_available,not_available,not_available,closed,secondary,Use accumulation,"This FÙllung is 2,90 metres high and comprises 58,6% of the volume of the cistern; 31% of the pottery was found in it, and 24% of the finewares; the 3 coins found date from around 100 BC, and are of the same type as those of similar date found in FÙllung 1; therefore the 4 lamps are also considered, of which 3 date to the second and first centuries BC, the fourth is dated to the late first century BC and early first century AD, which gives a terminus ante quem of the beginning of the first century AD (buf if this lamp is from one of the higher AhbÙben, then the lower part might be older; in fact the author hints at a tentative distinction on the basis of sherd count between AhbÙben 11 and 12); the author proposes this deposit date, including residual material; 20 Forms of ESC are represented, most common are S8 and T2; sherds with a dark and mottled slip still predominate but less so than in FÙllung 1. SlaneÍs comment for Zisterne 3, FÙllung 1 also seems to have implications for the chronology of this FÙllung, as some of the problematic Forms also occur here."
1970,PERGA88-Zisterne 3 FÙllung 3,130,170,Quadrant I 17.,not_available,not_available,not_available,open,secondary,Rubbish accumulation,"This FÙllung is 1,90 metres high and spans about 26,2% of the volume; only 4,7% of the pottery was found here, with 3,5% of the finewares; the dating is highly insecure, as almost no small finds (including coins) were found; one kitchenware jug handle (cf. Kr2) may date to around AD 150 and as such dates Phase 2 of the cistern which includes the cutting of its upper part following the lowering of the surrounding floor, and completely filling the cistern; earlier sherds stretches back to the early first century AD, but because of these and even older fragments a terminus post quem cannot be determined; ESC is represented with 17 Forms, it was not possible to establish whether certain Forms were better represented (because of their fragmentation?); most sherds had a red or red-brown slip; during the phase of use of the cistern the room in which it is located was in use as a dole kitchen (?)."
1971,PERGA88-Zisterne 4 FÙllung 1,-60,-40,Quadrant I K4a.,not_available,not_available,not_available,closed,secondary,Debris,"This fill is 1,60 metres high, comprises 58% of the cistern's volume, 80% of the pottery and about 70% of the tablewares. The one coin from this cistern was found in Abhub 9, and dates to 150-100 BC. More important for the dating are the lamps: the oldest (L19, L22) date to the second, early first century BC, so also L18 but this goes further into the first century BC; to the mid-first century BC go L20-1 and L23-4, and the latter two were found in the two lowest AbhÙben. 20 Forms of ESC were identified, esp. N1, S6-7 and B2. The slip is mostly dark or mottled, whilst red or red-brown occurs rarely. It is possible that the lower part of this FÙllung may be separated as the earliest fill of some sort of this Zisterne, datable to the early first century BC (see p. 43)."
1972,PERGA88-Zisterne 4 FÙllung 2,100,125,Quadrant I K4a.,not_available,not_available,not_available,closed,secondary,Debris,"This FÙllung is 2,85 metres deep, and comprises the remaing 20% of the pottery (and 30% of the tablewares). No coins were found, and dating seems to rely on the lamps. The oldest is L29 found in Abhub 7, datable between the late first century BC and the mid-first century AD, possibly extending into the early second. L25-8 post-date AD 1: L26 to AD 1-50, L25 to AD 50-100, and L27-8 may continue into the early second century AD. Therefore, the terminus ante quem of FÙllung 2 is placed to AD 100-125, given the lamps here and the pottery in the lower floor level. 32 Forms of ESC were identified, which is remarkable given the small percentage of pottery from this FÙllung (the author mentions nothing about residuality; pottery predating 50 BC appears to be present). The author considers that this may also have to do with the long time-span of FÙllung 2. Especially common are N2-3 and N39a, but also Kr2. Red-slipped fragments occur twice as much as dark and mottled ones."
1973,PERGA88-Zisterne 5 FÙllung 1,-60,-40,Quadrant II F8c.,not_available,not_available,not_available,closed,,Destruction debris,"This fill is 1,10 metres deep, comprises 38,4% of the cistern's volume, and 61,4% of the pottery was found in it, and about 60% of the tablewares. One coin was found, of Pergamene mint and datable to 350-280 BC. The 8 lamp fragments were all found in the lower part of Abhub 11, which places them to this FÙllung (it is thus also distinguished on the basis of stratigraphy, i.e. soil composition?). L31-2 and L38 date to the late second, early first century BC, L34 to the second half of the second, early first century BC, L36-7 date to the late second, perhaps into the early first century BC, whilst L33 and L35 date till or to the mid-first century BC. Whereas the lamps provide a terminus ante quem for the end of this first phase around 50 BC, the coin which was found at the bottom of the Zisterne may only relate to the use of the cistern. 13 Forms of ESC were identified, and only S7, N1 and T29 are quite common. The slip is mostly dark and/or mottled, while fragments with a red-brown slip are rare. Note that the lower part of this FÙllung may include or comprise vessels relating to the period of use of the Zisterne."
1974,PERGA88-Zisterne 5 FÙllung 2,100,133,Quadrant II F8c.,not_available,not_available,not_available,,secondary,Destruction debris,"This fill is about 2,40 deep, comprises 57,4% of the cistern's volume, and contains 38,6% of the pottery, and 39,5% of the tablewares. Of the three coins, one is Late Hellenistic, whereas the others, dated to AD 117-138 and AD 80-130, are taken as evidence that the cistern was filled in the first third of the second century AD, or slightly later. Lamps L40-2 date to the second half of the first century AD, whilst L39 dates to the early second century AD. 29 Forms of ESC were identified, of which N2-3, N9b, N36, SÙ9 and Kr2. Fragments with a red and red-brown slip are most common, and those with a dark or mottled slip are rare."
1975,PERGA88-Zisterne 6 FÙllung 1,-100,-76,Quadrant II G10a.,not_available,not_available,not_available,closed,,Debris,"This FÙllung is 0,80 m. deep, and comprises 13,3% of the volume. It included 12% of the pottery, and 8% of the tablewares. No coins were found, so the dating relies on two lamp fragments and an amphora stamp. L43-4 mainly date to the late second, early first century AD, the amphora stamp dates to the second century BC. Other finds (not specified) date to the early first century BC or earlier. 23 ESC Forms were identified, of which only S8 and N2 were quite common. Fragments with a dark and mottled slip are more common than fragments having a red-brown slip. Noteworthy is the scarcity (n=39) of West-Slope Ware, mouldmade bowls and white-grounded pottery, three categories much more common in contemporary deposits."
1976,PERGA88-Zisterne 6 FÙllung 2,-75,25,Quadrant II G10a.,not_available,not_available,not_available,closed,,Destruction debris,"This fill was 1,85 metres deep and comprised 59,2% of the volume. 86% of the pottery was found in this fill, and 89,4% of the tablewares. Three of the seven datable coins provide a (very) general idea about the chronology: two date to the second and first centuries BC, while a third dates to the third through first centuries BC. In addition, L45-51 and L53 date to the second, the early or to the mid-first century BC; L52 dates to the second and first centuries BC, possibly into the early first century AD. To the author this suggests that the fill may date to the last three quarters of the first century BC, perhaps even thrown in during the early first century AD. 30 Forms of ESC are represented. N2, N4a, T2 and T29 were most common, and S8-9, B3, N3 and Sa24a were somewhat common. The author noted a strong increase of fragments with a red and red-brown slip, and has a ratio to those with a dark or mottled slip of 1:1. Noteworthy is the high quantity of fragments with appliqu_s (about 250), especially in AbhÙbe 13-17. Compared to FÙllung 1, West-Slope Ware (n=119), mouldmade bowls (n=196) and white-grounded pottery (n=328) are well represented, the latter category even slightly stronger than 'normal'. SlaneÍs comment for Zisterne 3, FÙllungen 1 and 2 also seems to have implications for the chronology of this FÙllung, as some of the problematic Forms also occur here."
1977,PERGA88-Zisterne 6 FÙllung 3,,,Quadrant II G10a.,not_available,not_available,not_available,closed,,Rubbish accumulation,"This fill was 1,30 metres deep and comprised AbhÙbe 11 (its upper half) through 1. It encompassed 22,7% of the volume of the cistern, and with 2% of the pottery, and 2,6% of the tablewares, it is the FÙllung with the sparsest contents of this Zisterne. One lamp fragment was found, datable to the second century AD, and one coin of Septimius Severus, suggest to the author that this FÙllung may have been thrown in during the early third century AD, which is circumstantially supported by a fragment of Gladiatorenkeramik, found in Abhub 4. Only 8 Forms of ESC were identified, and most fragments had a red slip; fragments with a dark or mottled slip were rare."

Less than a few dozen pottery fragments were collected at the surface;  they appeared scarce among the myriad of blocks. Lenoir thinks, based on the few identifiable fragments of ARSW that the origins of the camp go back to the Severan period. No PRSW was recognized, which leads the author to suggest the camp was abandoned prior to the mid-fifth century AD."

See also pp. 593-4: 'Group 1, deposited between the scenery-store tracks of the original stage building in the early to mid first century AD may represent activity before the end of the life of that building, or may contain residual material disturbed during other processes. But it shows the early presence of Italian imports and the beginning of the transition of the long-established Black-Glaze tradition to that of Red Slip Ware, with identical forms being used, some of which imitate closely forms of other fine wares produced in Italy and elsewhere. Not all forms represent continuity however, since this group sees the final appearance of, for example, late Hellenistic pink-surfaced cooking ware.' These two contexts were 'sealed' by Group 2."

Note however that residual Black Glaze (thus by now regarded as residual!) is present, which suggests that during the construction of the nymphaeum earlier levels were cut through, or such fragments were already present as residual material.

They are associated with the destruction of the nymphaeum, tentatively seen resulting from the earthquake of AD 375. This implies that the nymphaeum was destroyed or went out of use because of the earthquake, and was no longer in use afterwards. The authors seem to prefer to see this as a large dump of domestic rubbish, dumped after the destruction. The event, and the ARSW, seem to provide the basic dating evidence."

2484,SWC67-B.7,,,Site B.7.,not_available,not_available,not_available,open,mixed,Survey (surface),"ïThe site is strewn with abundant stones from buildings, and the ruins of an early Christian basilica church are visible. The body of the church measures inside about 15 metres in length by 12 metres in width, with an apse 3 metres wide and now 6 metres long, but in its original form evidently shorter. Part of the vaulted roof over the apse has survived, and a monolithic column of veined greyish-white marble is standing in position on the north side of it (Plate 6). Other columns are lying in the body of the church. Traces of frescoes are preserved in the apse. These may date from some later restoration of the church. The settlement may have been reoccupied after the reconquest of Crete from the Arabs in A.D. 961. Gerola, however, in describing the Venetian castle of Frangokastelli (Castel-franco), built soon after A.D. 1370 against piratical descents and rebellions in the area, makes no mention of a settlement here and comments upon the unique isolation of the castle in the midst of the deserted plain.Í; of the pottery kept, one glazed sherd was clearly medieval, while Late Roman Red Wares and horizontal and wavy combed amphorae sherds were also noted"

These are two of the only three lots identified as building fill that contained long-petal bowls (four of the ten fragments in these lots), and, like the other late pottery they are likely to be part of an intrusion. The third lot (T 593) contained a single long-petal bowl fragment but no clear evidence of intrusion. Eugene Vanderpool observed while excavating in the building in 1936 that material of the 1st century was found in and under the floor of the Stoa at its west end, but this pottery was apparently not saved. The terminal date would seem to be ca. 140, with lst-century disturbance, possibly in connection with the drain trench discussed below.
